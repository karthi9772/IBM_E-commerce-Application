#Artisanal E-commerce Platform on IBM Cloud Foundry

##Problem Definition:
The digital landscape is bustling with e-commerce platforms, but there is a notable gap for specialized artisanal platforms.
Our aim is to fill this void by creating an artisanal e-commerce platform using IBM Cloud Foundry. 

###The primary objectives are:
Bridging skilled artisans with a global audience.
Offering a dedicated space to showcase handmade products such as jewelry, home decor, and more.
Ensuring online transactions are secure and user-friendly with features like secure shopping carts, integrated payment gateways, and an intuitive checkout process.
Crafting a user-centric design that caters to both the artisans, 
by providing them with an efficient interface to manage their products and orders, and the customers, by offering them a seamless shopping experience.

##Design Thinking:

Product Categoriesfor efficient product discovery.
Individual Product Pageswith detailed descriptions, images, and artisan profiles.
Shopping Cartwith clear product details and the option to easily add or remove items.
Checkoutwith multiple payment options and a clear summary of the purchase.
###2. Product Showcase:
A robust database is crucial for storing extensive product details:
Utilize IBM Cloud Databases to store product images, detailed descriptions, pricing, categories, and artisan details.

Secure and hassle-free user experience is paramount:
Implement registration and login mechanisms for both artisans and customers.
Ensure data protection with encrypted passwords and possibly two-factor authentication.
###4. Shopping Cart and Checkout:

Integrate with renowned payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, etc.
Ensure transaction details are encrypted and secure.
Provide a clear payment confirmation and digital receipt.
